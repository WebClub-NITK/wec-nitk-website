Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC) are university-based community groups for students keen on developer technologies. We host workshops, events, and project-building activities to help students hone their skills. We also collaborate with local businesses and communities to craft solutions using Google technology.

GDSC NITK is a vibrant part of this network under the WebClub umbrella. Active for the past 5 years, we strive to boost participation in software development across the campus. Our activities include regular workshops, knowledge transfer sessions for newcomers, and a host of fun internal events!
